PROGRESS VIDEO FOR THE FIRST WEEK

THE FIRST WEEK TASK WAS ACTUALLY BASED ON CREATING TWO STATIC WEBSITES 
THE WEBSITES THAT I CHOSE FOR THIS TASK WAS SPOTIFY AND MYNTRA

I ALREADY HAD PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE IN CREATING STATIC WEBSITES SO I WAS ABLE TO COMPLETE IT FASTER THAN I EXPECTED
THEN I DECIDED TO MAKE IT BIT OF PIXEL PERFECT AS WELL 

THEN I DECIDED TO FOCUS ON BIT OF A THEORY OF CSS AS WELL AS HTML. I WAS A BIT TENSED ON THE THEORY CONCEPTS I HAD TO COVER BECAUSE THE ADVANCED CONCEPTS LIKE
SHADOW DOM AND CREATING CUSTOM WEB ELEMENTS WERE ACTUALLY A BIT HARD TO GRASP 

WE ALSO HAD TO FOCUS ON THE TECHNICAL NON TECHNICAL AND MISCCELLENEOUS TASK AS WELL IN THE TECHNICAL SIDE THE TASK WAS TO CREATE TWO WEBSITES
AND IN THE NON TECHNICAL SIDE THE TASK WAS TO CREATE VISION BOARD AND AFFIRMATIONS THAT ACTUALLY POSED AS A REMAINDER WITH WHICH WE WERE ABLE TO REMEMBER WHY WE CAME 
HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE 

THERE WAS TYPING LESSONS TO BE COMPLETED TOO THE TYPING LESSONS IT WAS FUN TO COMPLETE AND IT WAS A PRODUCTIVE HOUR SPEND BECAUSE TYPING SPEED ESPECIALLY IN OUR PROFESSION IS ACTUALLY VERY IMPORTANT 
SO WITHIN ONE WEEK I WAS ABLE TO COMPLETE THE BASIC TASK AND I WAS ABLE TO COMPLETE THE TASK WITHIN THE SPECIFIED AMOUNT OF TIME TOO SO IN MY FREE TIME I MADE THE WEBSITE RESPONSIVE IN MULTIPLE DEVICES ESPECIALLY MOBILE AND TABLET
